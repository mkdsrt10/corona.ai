Our method uses a proprietary algorithm that is getting better with every day, with every person who helps us by updating their symptoms, and with geographic data provided by outside sources. We take all of those data points and use them to make a prediction that you can trust and help you decide what to do next and how to handle it. We donâ€™t claim to replace an emergency room but we do give you the advice you need to make your next step. </p>
